# note-taker

## Description

The code included in this repository is used to create an application that writes and saves notes. This application uses an Express.js back end to save and retrieve the notes data from a JSON file. The bullets below outline the functionality of the note taker application: 
* When the user opens the note taker, they are presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
* When the user clicks on the link to the notes page, they are presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
* When the user enters a new note title and the note’s text, a "Save Note" button and a "Clear Form" button appear in the navigation at the top of the page
* When the user clicks on the Save button, the new note they have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes and the buttons in the navigation disappear
* When the user clicks on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column, that note appears in the right-hand column and a "New Note" button appears in the navigation
* When the user clicks on the "New Note" button in the navigation at the top of the page, they are presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column and the button disappears
